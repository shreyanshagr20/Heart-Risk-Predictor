# Heart-Risk-Predictor

In this excercise, I have attempted to build multiple binary classification models leveraging CDC health survey data to model the probability of developing a heart disease and understaning the features that are relevant in predicting the same.

Models that I have tried include - 
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- XG Boost
- Ada Boost

Overall precision and recall was satisfactory and the model can be further improved by trying MLP models.
